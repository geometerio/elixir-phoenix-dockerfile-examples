The files in this repo are what you to need to copy into your Elixir/Phoenix project when you have a 
Postgres database.

Note that you'll need to change the values in `rel/overlays/bin/start_script` and `lib/sample_phoenix_app_with_postgres_db/release.ex`
to correspond with the name of your Elixir/Phoenix application.

The files in this repo are what you need to copy into your Elixir/Phoenix project when you don't have a database.
See [full repo here](https://github.com/geometerio/sample_phoenix_app_with_postgres_db).  The parts which have been edited
and are not Phoenix-generated boilerplate have been extracted out into this repo.
